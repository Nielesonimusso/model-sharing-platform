# Findings on the web resource OM2
This document presents the findings of the Software Engineering Project group 10 of Bachelor of Computer Science from Technical University of Eindhoven on the OM2 web resource.

## Initial assumptions
When the Ontology Based Conversion Library has been developed an assumption has been made upon extensively researching all units of measure. The assumption is that 2 units of measure are comparable (i.e. one can convert a quantity expressed by the initial unit of measure to a quantity expressed by the target unit of measure) if they measure the same dimension or if their base units of measure have the same sum of dimensions for each of the 7 SI dimensions. (More information about these units can be found under the ***Domain*** section of the website http://www.foodvoc.org/resource/om-2/Dimension).

## Broken links
The link http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/acceleration-Dmension is broken as it states Dmension instead of Dimension.

## Ambiguous dimension - Dimension One
In OM2 there exists a dimension called DimensionOne (more info at http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/dimensionOne). This dimension is defined in order to express units of measure that do not present a dimension factor in their description. <br/>
Because of this explanation of the dimension, terms that are not convertible between one another are deemed convertible by the logic of the structure of OM2. Examples:
* square metre per square metre - this unit of measure is used to describe a 2D quantity of length
* kilogram per kilogram - this unit of measure is used to describe a 1D quantity of mass
* metre per metre - this unit of measure is used to describe a 1D quantity of length
* magnitude - this unit of measure is used to describe the brightness of stars
* acoustic firmness - this unit of measure is used to describe an acoustic phenomenon

## Incosistencies
The web resource presents an easy way of understanding which dimension is measured by each unit of measure, through a predicate hasDimension. The library exploits this structure, by defining that if two units of measure have the same dimension, then they are comparable. However, there are *2192* out of *14656* units of measure that do not present this predicate. This fact has made the conversion protocol of this library more complex, resulting in computational performance penalties.<br/>
The units of measure that do not present this predicate are:
